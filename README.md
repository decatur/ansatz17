This is a simple and fast parser for GNU Octave or MATLABÂ®.
It is a single file solution with about 100 lines of code and no dependencies.

# Requirements
GNU Octave version minimum 4.0 or MATLAB about version 2008 (verified for 2013b).

# Example Simple Expression Parser
```
cd examples;
addpath('../');
p = ExprParser();
[ast, parseError] = p.parse('x+2*3-power(2,3)*(4-1)');
evalExpr(ast, struct('x', 1))
ans = -17
evalExpr(ast, struct('x', 18))
ans = 0

% Without subclassing parser only tokenizes
p = Parser();
[tokens, parseError] = p.parse('1 foo "bar"')
```

# Usage:

The parser emits an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It's not really a tree, but a Directed Acyclic Graph.
On this AST you can, for example,
* evaluate (as an example see test/evalExpr.m)
* validate
* compile

As far as I know there is one [much more potent parser in MATLAB](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/lectures/01_lecture.html), admitting I could not make it work for me.


# AST Explained
The emitted AST is 
```
ast = parse('1.2+3.14')
  [1,1] =
      type = numerical
      value =  1.2
  [1,2] =
      type = numerical
      value =  3.14
  [1,3] =
      type = +
      head =  1
      tail =  2

```
returns a cell array with three nodes. A reference is expressed as an integer pointing to the referenced index.
We will denote the reference to index `I` by `$I`.
```
addpath('test')
prettyPrintAST(parse('1.2+3.14'))
```
| Index | Rule | Head | Tail |
|-------|------|------|------|
| $1 |  numerical | value: 1.2 |
| $2 |  numerical | value: 3.14 |
| $3 |          + | head: $1 | tail: $2 |

```
prettyPrintAST(parse('3.14+foo'))
```

| Index | Rule | Head | Tail |
|-------|------|------|------|
| $1 |  numerical | value: 3.14 |
| $2 | identifier | name: foo |
| $3 |          + | head: $1 | tail: $2 |

```
prettyPrintAST(parse('power(2, 2)'))
```

| Index | Rule | Head | Tail |
|-------|------|------|------|
| $1 | identifier | name: power |
| $2 |  numerical | value: 2 |
| $3 |  numerical | value: 2 |
| $4 |   funccall | head: $1 | tail: $2, $3,  |


# Implementation Design

The parser is of the top-down operator precedence variety based on ideas by Vaughan Pratt, see 
http://effbot.org/zone/simple-top-down-parsing.htm or
http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html

TODO: Explain Advantage, disadvantage...

Code must run on both Octave and MATLAB. The former may not support handles to nested functions.
As a workaround we use anonymous functions instead.
The scanner/tokenizer instantiates tokens, which in turn implement parser logic.
This woefull fact prevents us from making the tokenizer a top-level function.

# Limitations Octave (as of 4.0)

* Cannot create handle to nested function
* No closures (read/write access to scoped variables)
* Nested functions to methods do not share method scope, not even read only.
